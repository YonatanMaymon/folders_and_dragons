plan for the game:

make 3 windows-
one is the file explorer that shows the map,
the secound is a small window you need to be focosed on in order to put an input, which will show the player stats as well,
the last will show combat logs,
they will be orgenized like so: file explorer on the top, player data on the bottom and combat log will be on the left.

take the same game logic of the first dungen and dragons game, and make it harder and more playble.

the game needs to have a folder for all of the imges it needs to use and on lvl loading it will loud this images based on the text lvl layout.
